He enjoyed his life of freedom and excitement. One day, he was ambushed by a group of bandits near Whiterun. He fought back, but he was outnumbered and outmatched. He took an arrow in the knee, and fell to the ground. He thought he was going to die, but he was saved by a patrol of Whiterun guards. They drove off the bandits and took him to the city. He recovered from his wound, but he could no longer run or jump. He realized that his days of adventuring were over. He felt lost and depressed. He stayed in Whiterun, living off his savings and doing odd jobs. He befriended some of the guards who had saved him, and learned more about their duty and honor. He saw how they protected the city and its people from all kinds of threats. He admired them, and wished he could be one of them. He decided to join the guard, and asked his friends to vouch for him. They agreed, and he was accepted into the ranks. He was given a uniform and a helmet, and assigned to patrol the city streets. He felt proud and happy. He still remembers his past life, but he does not regret his choice. He serves Whiterun with loyalty and courage. He supports Jarl Balgruuf, and follows the Dragonborn’s lead. He is Rolf, a Whiterun guard.",
