He took an arrow in the knee, and fell to the ground. He thought he was going to die, but he was saved by a patrol of the city guards. They drove off the bandits and took him to the city. He recovered from his wound, but he could no longer run or jump. He realized that his days of adventuring were over. He felt lost and depressed. He stayed in the city, living off his savings and doing odd jobs. He befriended some of the guards who had saved him, and learned more about their duty and honor. He saw how they protected the city and its people from all kinds of threats. He admired them, and wished he could be one of them. He decided to join the guard, and asked his friends to vouch for him. They agreed, and he was accepted into the ranks. He was given a uniform and a helmet, and assigned to patrol the city streets. He felt proud and happy. He still remembers his past life, but he does not regret his choice. He serves the city with loyalty and courage. He supports his Jarl.",

He performs at the Bannered Mare with Mikael, another bard who he dislikes for being a womanizer. He wants to join the Bards College, but his parents are against it. He enjoys hunting and fishing with his brother Lars, and reading books about heroes and legends. He fears that the war will destroy his family and his city, and that his love for Olfina will be exposed. He hopes for peace and harmony in Skyrim, and for a chance to fulfill his dreams.",
