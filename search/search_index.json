Get almost instant responses that stay true to each character's unique personality, and immerse yourself even further in the game's universe. This is the future of roleplaying games.  Note that this mod does not provide the full capabilities of the Inworld AI but rather only amplifies the joy you can get out of the conversations you have with the AI.
